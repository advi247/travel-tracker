This project was a part of myweb D course, and I worked on the backend sections
1) open pgadmin4, copy the contents of the queries.sql file and execute them
2) open a new terminal and execute npm i, to install all the node packages
3) check the dependencies section in package.json to ensure that body-parser, express, ejs and pg are all listed
4) now execute **nodemon index.js**
5) go to **localhost:3000** in your browser
